# National Park Roadtripper

## About the App

With COVID-19 still preventing air travel, road trips are seeing an increase 
in popularity. The goal of our app is to help in the road trip planning 
process. Our app starts by recommending a national park to travel to based on 
user inputs and a random forest model. Users are then able to plan their routes 
by inputting their starting point address or landmark, and choosing their 
destination park. Users might also like to let the app suggest a playlist for 
their drive, either by park or by genre. Finally, our app is able to recommend 
a packing list for the user based on certain inputs, such as time of year and 
trip duration.
